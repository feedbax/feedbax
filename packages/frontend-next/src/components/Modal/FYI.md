# Only one question. WHY?!

Well, this whole Modal thing is way to complex and was
just implemented like this, because next/dynamic
seems to be buggy in combination with react-dom/createPortal.

It messed up my bundles and a lot of code was just cut out of it.
And that's why I implemented my own portal like solution for the modals.

Tried to reproduce the error in a codesandbox, but couldn't get it work. So I just worked my way around it.

`¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
